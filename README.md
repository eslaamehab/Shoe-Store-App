# README

* notes on last submission:
* My code changed went as follows
1. I have included data binding implementation in mainActicity.kt
2. I have added comments justifying my use of each layout in all xml
3. I have replaced the logout button in the layout with overflow menu containing logout item; but I have an inquire regarding this matter;
   in this course, Navigation ( concept 17 ) it says that I only need to give the menu item the id of the fragment i want to navigate to (without even needing to add corresponding navigation actions) am I missing anything?
   Thank you for time!
   The review is detailed and amazing
   Keep it up<3
